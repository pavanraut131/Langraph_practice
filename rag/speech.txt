It is truly an honor to stand before you today and talk about something that has shaped the greatest minds, the strongest leaders, and the most inspiring individuals throughout history—perseverance.

Life is full of challenges. At some point, we all face setbacks, failures, and moments where we feel like giving up. But what separates those who succeed from those who don’t is not talent, not luck, but the ability to keep going even when things get tough.

Think about some of the world’s most successful people. Thomas Edison failed over 1,000 times before he finally invented the lightbulb. J.K. Rowling was rejected by 12 publishers before Harry Potter became a global phenomenon. And Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players of all time, was cut from his high school team before he became a legend.

What do they all have in common? They refused to give up. They believed in their dreams and kept pushing forward, even when the world told them "no."

So, my message to you today is simple: keep going. No matter how hard things get, no matter how many times you fail, remember that every step forward—no matter how small—brings you closer to your goals.
